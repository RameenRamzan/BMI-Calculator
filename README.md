## 🧮 How BMI is Calculated

BMI is calculated using the formula:

$$
\text{BMI} = \frac{\text{weight (kg)}}{(\text{height (m)})^2}
$$

The result is interpreted as:

| BMI Range      | Category    |
| -------------- | ----------- |
| Less than 18.5 | Underweight |
| 18.5 – 24.9    | Normal      |
| 25.0 – 29.9    | Overweight  |
| 30.0 and above | Obese       |
